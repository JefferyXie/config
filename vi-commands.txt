1) remove all white space in a file and replace with a comma
First delete the blank lines:
:g/^\s*$/d
Then use a substitution (:s///) over each line (%) to replace all (g) continuous whitespace (\s\+) with a comma (,)
:%s/\s\+/,/g

2) replace character/word in a file
replace 'foo' with 'bar' in a file
:%s/foo/bar/g
replace only whole words exactly match
:%s/\<foo\>/bar/g
