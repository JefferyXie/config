AppDomain
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.aspx
Application domains, which are represented by AppDomain objects, help provide isolation, unloading, 
and security boundaries for executing managed code.
1) Use application domains to isolate tasks that might bring down a process. If the state of the 
AppDomain that's executing a task becomes unstable, the AppDomain can be unloaded without affecting 
the process. This is important when a process must run for long periods without restarting. You can 
also use application domains to isolate tasks that should not share data.

2) If an assembly is loaded into the default application domain, it cannot be unloaded from memory 
while the process is running. However, if you open a second application domain to load and execute 
the assembly, the assembly is unloaded when that application domain is unloaded. Use this technique 
to minimize the working set of long-running processes that occasionally use large DLLs.

Multiple application domains can run in a single process; however, there is not a one-to-one correlation 
between application domains and threads. Several threads can belong to a single application domain, and 
while a given thread is not confined to a single application domain, at any given time, a thread executes 
in a single application domain.

MarshalByRefObject
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.marshalbyrefobject(v=vs.110).aspx
An application domain is a partition in an operating system process where one or more applications reside. 
Objects in the same application domain communicate directly. Objects in different application domains 
communicate either by transporting copies of objects across application domain boundaries, or by using a 
proxy to exchange messages.

MarshalByRefObject is the base class for objects that communicate across application domain boundaries by 
exchanging messages using a proxy. Objects that do not inherit from MarshalByRefObject are implicitly marshal 
by value. When a remote application references a marshal by value object, a copy of the object is passed 
across application domain boundaries.

MarshalByRefObject objects are accessed directly within the boundaries of the local application domain. The 
first time an application in a remote application domain accesses a MarshalByRefObject, a proxy is passed 
to the remote application. Subsequent calls on the proxy are marshaled back to the object residing in the 
local application domain.

Types must inherit from MarshalByRefObject when the type is used across application domain boundaries, and 
the state of the object must not be copied because the members of the object are not usable outside the 
application domain where they were created.
