How to config VI?

1) install Vundle
https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

2), open vi and :PluginInstall to install plugins (inclusing YCM)

3), you will receive a warn message as below, don't be scared:

ycm_client_support.[so|pyd|dll] and ycm_core.[so|pyd|dll] not detected;
you need to compile YCM before using it. Read the docs!

Let's compile YCM modules! You can compile both YCM and clang, or you can use your system's libclang, and only compile YCM. I will elaborate only compiling both.

Make sure you have cmake, python-dev installed.

cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.sh --clang-completer

4), update file ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp/ycm/.ycm_extra_conf.py
